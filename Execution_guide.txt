🚀 Step-by-Step Execution Guide


Step 1: Start the C2 Server (The Brain)

You must run the main server first so that the "agents" (payloads) have something to connect to.

Go back to the main CHIMERA directory:

cd ..

Start the server:

python chimera_server.pyExpected Output:

🐉 Chimera C2 Server is running on port 5000...
Use 'CHIMERA> help' for commands

Keep this terminal window open. This is your command center.


Step 2: Compile the "Pegasus" Module (The Eye)

This is the C++ code that will (in simulation) access the camera.

Open a new terminal window (or tab).

Navigate to the modules folder.

Compile the C++ file:

g++ modules/pegasus_camera.cpp -o modules/pegasus_agent `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`Note: If  pkg-config  doesn't work in Termux, you might need to link OpenCV manually or install it via  pkg install opencv . If compilation fails, we will handle the error in the next section.


Step 3: Simulate the "Ghost" Agent (The Hand)

Since we are likely on a Linux/Android system (Termux), we won't be running the PowerShell script. Instead, we will simulate the Ghost agent using Bash.

In your new terminal, make the GeoSpy script executable:

chmod +x modules/fing_geospy.sh

Run the network and location scan:

bash modules/fing_geospy.shThis will scan your local network and determine your IP location, then send a report to the C2 server (if the server is running and the script is edited with your C2 IP).


Step 4: Run the OSINT "Sherlock" Module (The Mind)

This gathers intelligence. You need to specify a username to search for.

Run the Sherlock module:

python modules/sherlock_intel.py <username>Replace  <username>  with a real username you want to look up (e.g.,  python modules/sherlock_intel.py john_doe ).

Note: You need to have the actual Sherlock project cloned into a folder named  sherlock  inside this directory for this to work.

 

🐞 Troubleshooting Common Issues (Termux/Android)

Given your path ( u0_a195 ), you are likely running this on an Android device via Termux. Here are fixes for common errors:


1. Camera Access Error (Pegasus)

If the C++ code fails to compile or run due to camera permissions:

Fix: Termux needs explicit camera permission.

pkg install termux-api
termux-camera-info # This will prompt for permission

The C++  VideoCapture  might not work directly. You might need to use  termux-camera-photo  as a fallback in the script.


2. "Permission Denied" on Scripts

If you get "Permission Denied" when running  .sh  files:

Fix: Run  chmod +x filename.sh  on each script.


3. Port 5000 Not Accessible

If the server starts but agents can't connect:

Fix: Make sure your firewall allows loopback or local network traffic. For local testing, use  127.0.0.1  or your local IP (e.g.,  192.168.x.x ).
